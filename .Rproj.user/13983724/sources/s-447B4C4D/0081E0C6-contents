# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: @becton2014generational

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat("### Pressure vs Temp {-} \n \n") #explicitly naming the tab
plot(pressure) #the plot of interest
cat("\n \n") #adding two line breaks after the plot

cat("### Hist of Temp {-} \n \n")
hist(pressure$temperature)
cat("\n \n")

cat("### Hist of Pressure {-} \n \n")
hist(pressure$pressure)
cat("\n \n")
```

# References {-}

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
